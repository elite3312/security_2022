1. How to Change Your User Agent
## Change Your User Agent in Chrome
Open Chrome's Developer Tools by right-clicking anywhere and choosing Inspect, hitting Ctrl + Shift + I, or by pressing F12  
At the bottom of the resulting panel, you should see a section with the tabs Console, Network conditions, and What's New. Press Esc to show this if you don't see it.

On the Network conditions tab, uncheck Select automatically and you can then choose a new user agent from the list. Refresh to update the page with the new agent.

Note that this setting will revert back to normal when you close the developer panel, and only applies to your current tab.
